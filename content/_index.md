        Welcome to the Formal Methods & Intelligent Design Laboratory (**FORMiND Lab**), led by Dr. Min LI. Established in June 2025, FORMiND Lab is affiliated with both [NCTIEDA](https://www.nctieda.com/) and [the School of Integrated Circuits at Southeast University](https://ic.seu.edu.cn/); our research group is primarily based in Nanjing && Shenzhen, China.


        FORMiND Lab prioritizes **solid end-to-end improvements** in hardware design and verification, moving beyond paper/èƒ¶ç‰‡-only "breakthroughs". Ultimately, our goal is to empower China's domestic hardware formal verification tools to achieve global leadership.

        We will develop an **AI-augmented verification toolchain** based on [SymbiYosys](https://yosyshq.readthedocs.io/projects/sby/en/latest/), targeting pure RTL datapath verification. **With AI-native architectural principles embedded throughout the development lifecycle**, the enhanced codebase is scheduled for release by Q4 2025.
