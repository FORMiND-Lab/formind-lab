        Welcome to the Formal Methods & Intelligent Design Laboratory (**FORMiND Lab**), led by Professor Min Li. Established on January 6, 2025, our research group is primarily based in Nanjing and Shenzhen.


        FORMiND Lab prioritizes **solid end-to-end improvements** in hardware design and verification, moving beyond paper/胶片-only "breakthroughs". Ultimately, our goal is to empower China's domestic hardware formal verification tools to achieve global leadership.
