ShiBo Zhao is a recent graduate from the School of Integrated Circuit Science and Engineering at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. I will pursue my Master's degree at the School of Integrated Circuits, Southeast University, starting in Fall 2025, under the supervision of Prof. Min Li.

My research interests broadly encompass **AI-driven Electronic Design Automation** and  **Digital Integrated Circuit Design and Verification**.
