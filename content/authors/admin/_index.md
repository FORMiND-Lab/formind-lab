Building Silicon-Proven Verification Tools.  Valuing substance over paper-only or 胶片 "breakthroughs". Ex. Huawei Engineer, critically aware of the pitfalls of over-promising without execution.

My current research interests span **Hardware Formal Verification**, including efficient verification of data-path circuits and equivalence checking across circuit modalities; and **AI4EDA**, including circuit representation learning for logic verification and synthesis. 

After two years intensively focused on industrial challenges, primarily through developing HiSilicon's in-house formal verification tool, I am now poised to publish **production-ready rigorous papers** that bridge academia and industry. Additionally, I am eager to explore collaboration opportunities with leading domestic EDA and circuit design companies.
