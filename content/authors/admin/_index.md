Building Silicon-Proven Verification Tools. Rejecting paper/胶片-only "breakthroughs". Ex. Huawei Engineer.

My current research interests span **hardware formal verification**, including efficient verification of data-path circuits and equivalence checking across circuit modalities; and **AI4EDA**, including circuit representation learning for VLSI testing.
